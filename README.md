This file will provide some information on what to expect out of the dashboard.

Below are some pictures showing what the full dashboard looks like.

On the left, we have line charts depicting historical data for Cryptocurrencies, World Indices and Currencies.

Below is the cryptocurrency chart. It displays information of the cryptocurrency "AVAX-USD" by default:

It's worth noting that the tables on the right do have some differences from each other. 
The cryptocurrency table includes closing price predictions, for instance.
